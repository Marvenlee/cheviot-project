# Building the Cheviot OS

# Requirements

A Linux system is required with common developer tools such as gcc, binutils, cmake make.
The following will get the required tools to build the project on Ubuntu 22.04.

```
    $ sudo apt install build-essential
    $ sudo apt install cmake
    $ sudo apt install automake autoconf
    $ sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
    $ sudo apt install texinfo
    $ sudo apt install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libmpc-dev
    $ sudo apt install mtools

    # Additionally the following may already be installed, if
    # not install them with:
    
    $ sudo apt install dosfstools
    $ sudo apt install fdisk
    $ sudo apt install file
```


# Cloning the project

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Marvenlee/cheviot-project.git
    $ cd cheviot-project
    $ git submodule update --init

```

# Building the project

CMake is used as a meta-build tool that is used to build individual projects
that are typical built with Autotools/Automake.

Build the project with the following commands from within the directory this
readme.md resides in. This will build the GCC cross compiler, Newlib library
and the kernel along with ksh, coreutils and several basic drivers for the
Raspberry Pi 4.

Modify the setup-env.sh to set the appropriate board, currently this
defaults to raspberrypi4.


```
    $ cd cheviot-project
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ source ../setup-env.sh
    $ cmake ..
    $ make pseudo-native    
    $ make
```

This will build the projects and populate the build/host folder which contains
the directory tree of the final root partition.

We then perform the following to build the final sd-card image:

```
    $ make image
```

This builds 3 images, the boot partition, the root partition and the combined sd-card image.

  * part1\_boot.fat
  * part2\_root.ext2
  * sdimage.img

The sdimage.img can be flashed to an SD-Card using dd, bmaptool or Balenaetcher. For example
if the sdcard is mounted as 2 partitions on the mmcblk0 device then unmount and flash the image
onto it with:

```
    $ umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
    $ umount /dev/mmcblk0p2
    $ sudo dd if=sdimage.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1M

```

# Building in a Docker Container

The "docker" folder contains scripts that can be used to set up a docker environment.

Install Docker with the following:

```
    $ sudo snap install docker
```

By default Docker requires running with "sudo" privileges. To give a normal user account
permission to run Docker without using "sudo" add a "docker" group and add the current
user to this group:

```
    $ sudo groupadd docker
    $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Build the Docker image "cheviot-image" from the docker folder. This may take some time
as it gathers the necessary packages and creates the image:

```
    $ ./build_docker.sh
```

Start the Docker container with:

```
    $ ./run_docker.sh
```

This will start the Docker container in interactive mode with a Bash shell in the home
directory of the "cheviot" user.  The top-level directory of the CheviotOS project
will be located in the sub-folder "project".  This folder is external to the Docker container,
it is a bind-mount to the project's top-level directory.  Any changes outside of the Docker
container are reflected in this folder.

To build the project, change directory into this folder, Â£/home/cheviot/project" and follow
the build steps above.  You will need to flash the created SD-Card image outside of the
Docker container as you will not have permission to unmount and write to block devices inside
the container.

The Docker container can be exited with the "exit" command.

The cleanup_docker.sh script can be used to delete all containers that use the "cheviot-image"
and the imqge itself.


# Running CheviotOS

Connect the Raspberry Pi 4 to a PC using a USB to Serial FTDI adaptor. The pins are
listed in the table below.


| Pi GPIO      | Pi Pin    | USB FTDI  |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- |
| TXD GPIO 14  | 8         | RX        | 
| RXD GPIO 15  | 10        | TX        | 
| GND          | 6         | GND       |


Open a terminal application on the PC, for example Minicom on Linux. Within the terminal
application select the USB FTDI as the serial port.

```
    $ sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0
```

In Minicon's serial port settings set the baud rate to 115200, 8 bits,
no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1) and disable software and hardware flow control.
In addition in the Terminal settings set the Backspace key to send the 'DEL' character.

Insert the SD-Card that was flashed with the image in the earlier steps and power on 
the Raspberry Pi.  After several seconds debug logs appear on the terminal followed by
a CheviotOS banner.  At this point you will be in a Korn shell and can enter commands
directly at the shell prompt.


# Notes

## Pseudo and File Permissions

Pseudo is used so that commands can run as a "virtual" sudo/root user and is used for
creating the root filesystem image with system files being assigned the root user
and group ID. Sqlite3 is used as a database of the generated files "virtual" permissions
so that we can set most files as being owned by root and with appropriate permissions.
See the pseudo man page and Yocto forums for details.

## Bootloader and IFS

The 'make image' command runs the tools/mk-kernel.img.sh script to create the kernel.img
that is placed on the boot partition.  This combines the bootloader and Initial File System
(IFS) image which contains the required files to bootstrap the system. The required files
includes the kernel, UART and other drivers.

## Partition Sizes

The setup-env.sh can be modified to increase the size of the partitions. Alter the
values for the following 2 variables.

  * BOOT\_PARTITION\_SIZE\_MB
  * ROOT\_PARTITION\_SIZE\_MB

Additional partitions could be created within the mk-sdcard-image.sh and mounting these
in the /etc/startup.cfg script.
